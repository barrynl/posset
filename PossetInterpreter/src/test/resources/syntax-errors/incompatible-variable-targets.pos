/*
The following shows a classic error where the AlternativeZeroDigit conceptually is 
a Digit, but it consists of two children instead of one, so it is incompatible with 
Digit which only has a single child). You should correct this in the following way:

main
(
	Digit first[A];
	AlternativeZeroDigit second
	(
		d[A];
	)
)

Note that in the future we might want to allow this if we implement public/private children. 
Variables could then only bind to public children and makes the syntax below correct. But this
is not the case in the current version.
