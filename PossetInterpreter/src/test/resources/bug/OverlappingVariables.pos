/* 
This posset contains intertwined variables, namely: C,D intertwine with E. This detects the bug where
the order in which the variables are collapsed is important. In this specific case, it should not have
possies at all, so if it has one or more possies, it is incorrect. If you watch the outcome closely,
you will notice it currently will return two different possies over a large number of runs, which is also incorrect.
